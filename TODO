 - Seems like some classes are considered as values (see flup.publisher)
 - Separate imported values from values only defined in the module
 - Indicate the inhertied classes
 - Add icons for files
 - Integrate with Kiwi for better formatting
 - Allow to split the output file using SNIP-SNIP-SNIP so that it can be easily
   recombined.
