== SDoc ToDo-list

Features:

 [ ] More contrast in sytlesheet
 [ ] Add support for including source code in API documentation
 [ ] Separate imported values from values only defined in the module
 [ ] Indicate the inhertied classes
 [ ] Add icons for files
 [ ] Allow to split the output file using SNIP-SNIP-SNIP so that it can be easily
     recombined.
Bugs:

 [ ] Seems like some classes are considered as values (see flup.publisher)
